select geo,impressions,clicks
from marketing_data
union
select revenue, date
from store_revenue;

Question #4 In your opinion, what is the most efficient store and why?​

I Believe the most efficient store is brand_ID 1 for CA 0n 1/1/16. The reason why is said this as I used to excel to filter revenue by biggest to smallest. When I got the highest revenue store, I copied the marketing data set on the same sheet but next to the sales revenue sheet, I filtered that as well by geo. Once that was done, I soon found out the geo CA on 1/1/16 didn’t have the highest impression or clicks but yet their revenue was the highest. 
What this indicates that their marketing strategy is very good as they are not spending a lot of money on it which is why they are producing the highest revenue.


Question #5 (Challenge) Generate a query to rank in order the top 10 revenue producing states​

select
  rank() over(order by revenue desc) as rank,
  dense_rank() over(order by revenue desc) as dense_rank,

from store_revenue;
